# PolynomialCalculator

This is a polynomial calculator that can perform four operations for any polynomial you wish: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It assumes all the exponents are nonnegative integers.

To use it, first enter the coefficient, then a space, then the exponent. Then after another space, repeat this for however many monomials the polynomial contains.

It automatically adds together monomials of the same exponent, so when the polynomial output is displayed, it is in simplest form. Monomials with an exponent of 1 are just shown as a constant multiplied by x and monomials with an exponent of 0 are shown as a constant.
