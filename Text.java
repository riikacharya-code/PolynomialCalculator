     * Returns a textual representation of the polynomial the method is called on.
     * The textual representation should be a sum of monomials, with each monomial 
     * being defined by a double coefficient, the letters "x^", and an integer exponent.
     * Exceptions to this rule: coefficients of 1.0 should be omitted, as should "^1",
     * and "x^0".
     * 
     * Terms should be listed in decreasing-exponent order. Terms with zero-coefficient
     * should be omitted. Each exponent can only appear once. 
     * 
     * Rules for separating terms, applicable to all terms other that the largest exponent one:
     *   - Terms with positive coefficients should be preceeded by " + ".
     *   - Terms with negative coefficients should be preceeded by " - ".
     * 
     * Rules for the highest exponent term (i.e., the first):
     *   - If the coefficient is negative it should be preceeded by "-". E.g. "-3.0x^5".
     *   - If the coefficient is positive it should not preceeded by anything. E.g. "3.0x^5".
     * 
     * The zero/empty polynomial should be represented as "0.0".
     * 
     * Examples of valid representations: 
     *   - "2.0x^2 + 3.0"
     *   - "3.5x + 3.0"
     *   - "4.0"
     *   - "-2.0x"
     *   - "4.0x - 3.0"
     *   - "0.0"
     *   
     * Examples of invalid representations: 
     *   - "+2.0x^2+3.0x^0"
     *   - "3.5x -3.0"
     *   - "- 4.0 + x"
